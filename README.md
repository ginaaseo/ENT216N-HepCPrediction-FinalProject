ENT216N Final Project 

Machine Learning application based project on predicting HepC in patients that are blood donors:


The topic chosen for this project is Hepatitis C. Hepatitis C is a viral infection that causes inflammation within the liver. The virus can cause both acute and chronic hepatits, ranging in severity from a mild illness to a serious, lifelong illness including liver cirrhosis and cancer. The bloodborne virus is spread through exposure to infected blood from unsafe injection practices, unsafe health care, unscreened blood transfusions, injection drug use, and sexual practices that lead to exposure to blood. When it comes to symptoms, most people do not show in the first weeks after infection. It can take between two weeks to six months for the symptoms to appear. However, Hepatitis C cannot be spread through breast milk, food, water, or casual physical contact with an infected person.

Currently, there is no vaccine for Hepatits C, however it can be treated affectively with antiviral medications. Early detection and treatment can also prevent serious liver damage and improve long-term health. The WHO reccomends therapy with pan-genotypic direct-acting ativirals for all adults, adolescents, and children with chronic hepatitis C infections. However, access to such treatments remains limited but are seeing improvements. Of the 50 million living with HCV infection globally, an estimated 36% knew their diagnosis and around 20% have been treated with DAAs by the end of 2022.

Because there is no effective vaccine, the best way to prevent the infection is to avoid contact with the virus. Extra care and precaution should be taken in healthcare settings and for people with higher risks of the HCV infection. Examples include safe handling and disposal of needles and medical waste, harm reduction and rehabilitation services for drug abuse, testing of donated blood, practice of safe sex, and proper and regulated training of health personnel.
